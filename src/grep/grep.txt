-e  --regexp=PATTERNS   
              Use  PATTERNS  as  the  patterns.   If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the -f (--file) option, search for all patterns
              given.  This option can be used to protect a pattern beginning with “-”.

-i  --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so that characters that differ only in case match each other.

-v  --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

-c  --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.  With the -v, --invert-match option (see  below),  count
              non-matching lines.

-l  --files-with-matches
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally have been printed.   Scanning  each  input
              file stops upon first match.

-n  --line-number
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.

-h  --no-filename
              Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is the default when there is only one file (or only standard input) to search.

-s  --no-messages
              Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.

-f  --file=FILE
              Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the -e (--regexp) option, search for  all
              patterns given.  The empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

-o  --only-matching
              Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output line.
